Most of the blocks have vanilla behaviours, like what their base block behaves. For example, bedrock stairs and slabs are explosion-immune and wither-immune like bedrock, and wool fences and fence gates are flammable and can be sheared.\nWith this mod you can make more fascinating buildings, and your survival can be also more interesting.",
